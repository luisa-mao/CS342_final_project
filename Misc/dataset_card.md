# 1. For what purpose was the dataset created? 
This dataset was created to enable Kaggle users to classify animals.

# 2. Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?

This was created by the anonymous user "antoreepjana."

# 3. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? 

Each instance is an image of an animal.

# 4. How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

For the portion of the dataset that we use (the top 11 classes), there are around 750 instances each.

# 5. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? 

The data is sampled from Google Open Images V6+, so it is a subset of a larger dataset.

# 6. Is there a label or target associated with each instance?

Yes, the class of the image is the target for most tasks.

# 7. Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)?

Yes. The data is split into training and validation.

# 8. Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? 

No. Images of animals have free use, and Google has already dealt with any liscensing issues.

# 9. Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?

If someone has an anxiety surrounding animals, then yes, but otherwise, no.

# 10. What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)

Google's pen Images V6+ API was used to collect the data.

# 11. Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?

I obtained this data from the 3rd party website Kaggle.
